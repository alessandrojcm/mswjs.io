## Pre-requisites

### URL polyfill

The `URL` class in React Native is not fully compliant with the [URL specification](https://url.spec.whatwg.org). This may lead to all sorts of unexpected behavior, as Mock Service Worker creates and operates with URL instances on runtime.

<Action>Use a specification-compliant URL class polyfill</Action>

Here are some of the recommended polyfills:

- [`react-native-url-polyfill`](https://github.com/charpeni/react-native-url-polyfill)

## Configure server

Let's create a file in our mock definition directory (`src/mocks`) where we would configure our request mocking server.

<Action>
  Create a <code>src/mocks/server.js</code> file
</Action>

```bash
$ touch src/mocks/server.js
```

In the `server.js` file we are going to create a server instance with our request handlers defined earlier.

<Action>
  Import <code>setupServer</code> function from the <code>msw/native</code>{' '}
  package and create a server instance with the previously defined request
  handlers
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=2,6
// src/mocks/server.js
import { setupServer } from 'msw/native'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

// This configures a request mocking server with the given request handlers.
export const server = setupServer(...handlers)
```

## Setup
